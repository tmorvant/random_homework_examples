This is a collection of homeworks from a  user interface construction class. These examples are very basic and meant to demonstrate basic understandings of concepts such as:
    - sockets (hw1)
    - scripting responses with html/javascript (hw2)
    - small use of node.js (hw3)
    - use of javascript for basic event handling through a small snake game for proof of concept over actual game functionality, as there are is no real scoring or eating to grow (hw3)
        might expand upon for creating full more functional game
    - use of angular js to format and sort tables (hw4)
    - use of javafx for simple two player tic tac toe (hw4)

Some of these small assignments can be easily expanded upon in the future to add more functionality
